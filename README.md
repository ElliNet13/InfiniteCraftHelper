# How do I install Infinite Craft Helper?

First, you need to install a userscript manager. For most people, Mikarific's recommendation is [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) because [it's completely open source](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey) and [doesn't track you with Google Analytics](https://redd.it/6hs59w/). However, any Greasemonkey 4.0+ compatible userscript manager should work. I use [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/). If you use Tampermonkey you may get some popups about it trying to connect to stuff.

Below is a list of browsers and userscript managers in order of Mikarific's recommendation.

<div align="left">

- Chrome (also Brave/Cent/Orion/Vivaldi/etc...) - [Violentmonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag), [Tampermonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
- Firefox (also Orion) - [Violentmonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/), [Firemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/firemonkey/), [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/), [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
- Microsoft Edge - [Violentmonkey](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/eeagobfjdenkkddmbclomhiblgggliao), [Tampermonkey](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd)
- Opera - [Violentmonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violent-monkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag), [Tampermonkey](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/)
- Safari - [Userscripts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887), [Tampermonkey](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tampermonkey/id1482490089)

  - Note: Although you _can_ install Infinite Craft Helper on iOS, Infinite Craft Helper does not support mobile.
